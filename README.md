Hi there,
I am Anirudh Nanwal, a web developer with a hands-on/relevant experience of 3 years on web development technologies which includes the following:

a) HTML 5 + CSS
b) Javascript (Advanced)
c) Reactjs
d) Java Core (1.8)
e) Spring MVC
f) Spring Rest
d) Spring Boot
f) Hibernate
g) MySQL server
h) Angular (Angular 1.x and 9.x)

My current project list consists of two items and is expanding as I learn new ideas and requirements:

a) Todo App
b) Hotel Management App

Both of the above apps are ready for deployment but as I am using Heroku as a deployment platform for free, I am unable to deploy using MySQL server provided in
the platform. The only option that I am left with is the deployment of the above apps using POSTGreSQL server which is available for free but due to lack of knowledge
on the this server, it will take some time till I deploy these apps using the mentioned SQL server. Hence, I have made the repository for these apps as private till
that time comes. However, if you have any ideas regarding a new project or have any doubts/queries once I make the repository public, please feel free to contact me
